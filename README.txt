Friend Finder!
This is the express plus node homework assignment for the UCF Coding Bootcamp.

In this assignment, we were asked to create a app which will find you a friend. I just modified it a bit so that you can find your research partner.

Getting Started
Research partner finder

Instructions:

The user goes to the home page first. They can view my github repo or API partner list but clicking on the link at the end of the body. 
When they click on the surey button it takes them to a different page, where the user has to input their name and a link to their photo. 
Then they are asked to answer 10 question and when they hit submit, based on their answers the system finds their match.
The system basically calculates the difference in scores between the user and all the other people on the list and selects one from the API list as their partner.
